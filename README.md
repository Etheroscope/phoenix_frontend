# Etheroscope.Umbrella

## Setup

### Mac

Before running the scripts make sure your current directory is the root of the project.

Follow the following instructions:
  1. `cd ./apps/devbox`
  2. `./macos` (if that fails, run `chmod +x macos` and try again)
  3. Voila!

### Windows

Not implemented yet :/
